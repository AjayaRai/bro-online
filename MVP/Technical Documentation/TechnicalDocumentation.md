**Project Objective**

The objective of the project is to build a website targeted towards male audience, which enables the user to create groups based on the individual work or interest. For example: a person could have hobbies such as GYM, coding, MMA; each of these hobbies can have its own group with different/same members in it.
A user should be able to join/leave groups as they please.
