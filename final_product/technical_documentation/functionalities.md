This has been achieved with the help of Firestore and the ReactJS. Firebase has a function where it listens to any changes on the database and once any changes happen, it detects it and send the data to the front end which updates the messages without needing to refresh the page which is thanks to the ReactJS, which updates and renders just the right component when there is a change in data.
