# Testing #
**Db testing**
This is used to test if certain code works or not. Show the code and explain what it does AND say how you test it

**Function emulator**
On the “Adding group member” part, the firebase function has been mentioned  which triggered when something is changed on the database, the issue with these functions is that once a developer has written the code, it then has to be deployed to the firebase server which then creates the function and stored it like so:

And this process takes long time; roughly about 7 minutes, which is a problem for the developer who has to make small changes and check if it is working iteratively. So, the 7 minutes adds up very quickly.

And that is why the emulator is used, the emulator will run on your local machine, and all the changes that you make to the function will get detected on the real-time without the need for the deployment.
