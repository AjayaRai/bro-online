# Description of the tools #
#### ReactJS ####
ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building web application. Rather than the conventional way, e.g. having many pages for different parts, ReactJS comes up with new concept which is known as Single Page Application. 

Single Page Application like its name suggest is just one page web application which is made up of component. The components can appear and disappear from the browser without needing to refresh the page, and the changes of the components are triggered by the state.

State is like a variable that can change depending on the program or the user actions, e.g. click of the button.

#### Axios ####
Axios is a JavaScript library, which can be used like a module on the ReactJS program.

Main purpose of the Axios is to send the HTTP request from the frontend to the backend.

#### Express Server ####
