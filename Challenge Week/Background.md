# Introduction
In beginning, I set out creating a web app which focus was to influence brotherhood formation in our society. However, now this idea has evolved into something else.

Now I think that brotherhood is not the focus; the focus should be placed on the individual's wants "what is the person's goal?".

Once the person has establish their desire, then they should look into creating/joining groups as an option if that helps them to accelerate towards their goal. Creating/joining group is what my product could help with.

# What is brotherhood?
Although, now I have concluded that the spark should start with a person's goal, I still think that considering the brotherhood in a group as a goal in itself would be beneficial. _Why would it be beneficial?_
