# Introduction
In beginning, I set out creating a web app which focus was to influence brotherhood formation in our society. However, now this idea has evolved into something else.

Now I think that brotherhood is not the focus; the focus should be placed on the individual's wants; "what is the person's goal?".

Once the person has establish their desire, then they should look into creating/joining groups as an option if that helps them to accelerate towards their goal. Creating/joining group is what my product could help with.

Although, now I have concluded that the spark should start with a person's goal, I still think that considering the brotherhood in a group as a goal in itself would be beneficial. _Why would it be beneficial?_

So the [Background Research](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_2020/ce301_rai_ajaya/-/blob/master/Challenge%20Week/Background%20Research.docx) is still relevant, where I researched topics:
- What is brotherhood?
- Advantages of brotherhood
- Disdvantages of brotherhood
- Why has brotherhood lost in our society?
- How have others gone about creating a male group within the society?
- Why building an app is one of the best ways to solve this issue (lack of positive male groups in our society)?
- What programming language to use?
- Masculine colours
- Group size
